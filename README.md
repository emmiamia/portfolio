# Emma Yue Portfolio (React + Vite)

This repository is a starter scaffold for a personal portfolio focused on web application and HCI work. It currently includes placeholder content plus a light visual style so you can iterate quickly.

## Available scripts

- `npm install` — install dependencies.
- `npm run dev` — start the Vite dev server at <http://localhost:5173>.
- `npm run build` — build production assets.
- `npm run preview` — serve the built assets locally.

## Next steps

1. Replace placeholder copy in `src/App.jsx` with your story and projects.
2. Add reusable components for case studies, research write-ups, or interactive demos.
3. Customize the visual system (color, typography, motion) to reflect your brand.
